virtual mouse using hand gestures

The aim of this project was to develop a virtual mouse system using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The virtual mouse allows users to control the mouse cursor on the screen by using hand gestures captured through a webcam.
Python programming language is used for developing the  virtual mouse system. In the proposed  virtual mouse system, the model makes use of the MediaPipe package for the tracking of the hands and for tracking of the tip of the hands,  and  PyAutoGUI  packages were used for moving around the window screen of the computer.
